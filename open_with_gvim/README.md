# Open with gVIM

KDE service menu which displays multiple selected files in gVIM using separated
tabs instead of opening them in buffers only. The advantage is to have all the
files immediately visible within the tabs instead of having to seek them manually
in the buffer list.

## Install

The archive contains a Makefile which can be used to install 
the content with ease, just access the subfolder with the terminal
and type:
```
$ make install
```

## Uninstall
To remove the installed file, just type from within the subfolder:
```
$ make uninstall
```
